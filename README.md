# Welcome to Weather application 
For weather forecast I use [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) api. 
### [Demo](https://mitchffirstgit.github.io/WeatherApp/) :zap:
## Current state
User can view 5 days forecast at any location or city, it includes weather data every 3 hours. User can see a list of favorite and recently viewed cities in the menu. Also in the menu he can enable/disable dark mode.
## Future plans
Convert app to PWA application.
## Technologies
* React Hooks
* Redux
* Reselect
* Typescript( add later )
* LocalStorage
* CSS modules
